VioLine - Play violin by just drawing on the screen!

Play violin by just drawing on the screen! It's a fun way to learn about music theory and intervals, but it's also an innovative new musical interface. Draw from left to right to play a higher note - and draw from right to left to play a lower note.
Just improvise or learn how to play popular songs - there are easy to understand charts online which show you how to play.

I use the sample-based audio library SoundBankPlayer by Matthijs Hollemans (see SoundBankPlayer.LICENSE.txt and SoundBankPlayer.README.txt).
