SoundBankPlayer

This is a sample-based audio player that uses OpenAL. A "sound bank" can have 
multiple samples, each covering one or more notes. This allows you to implement 
a full instrument with only a few samples (like SoundFonts but simpler).

The sounds in this demo project were taken from Fluid R3 by Frank Wen, a freely 
distributable SoundFont.
